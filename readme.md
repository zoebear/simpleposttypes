# Other Post Types Plugin
## By Morten Rand-Hendriksen

This plugin was created to demonstrate the principles of using Git and GitHub and provie a simple way of adding custom post types and taxonomies to a WordPress site without adding them to the theme functions.php file and without using an advanced settings plugin.

Assume nothing in this plugin works. Use at your own risk.
